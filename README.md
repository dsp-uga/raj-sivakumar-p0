# rajsiv12-p0

This project calculates word count and term frequency -inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) across 8 document collected from open sources. The program `p0.py` successively builds on itself. First it only does simple word count using map-reduce. The results of this step are written to `sp1.json` Then stopwords are removed in an additional preprocessing step in the next part of the program with results saved to `sp2.json`. Part 3 adds on another preprocessing step to remove leading and trailing punctuation. Part 4 calculates TF-IDF from two RDD's that are combined using the join method. The resulting RDD is used to map to the final TF-IDF calculation. These are saved to `sp3.json` and `sp4.json` respectively.
